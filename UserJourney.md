# User Journey

A sophomore computer science student is preparing for the upcoming semester. Last year, she struggled to balance her course load, ending up with classes not aligned with her major and little time for lunch. Determined to plan better, she opens the Academica App on her laptop.

She starts by exploring the course catalog in the app. She scrolls through available courses, filtering by department and interest, and clicks on a course to view its sections. The app displays detailed information, including section numbers, instructors, meeting times, and locations. For the first time, she can easily compare multiple sections of the same course without flipping through separate web pages.

Satisfied with her search, she creates a new schedule called “Fall 2025-1” The app instantly generates an empty schedule tied to her account.

Next, she adds sections to the schedule. Clicking “Add to Schedule” for each section, the app automatically ensures that no section is duplicated and updates the schedule in real time. She can now see a complete visual overview of her week, including class times and locations, ensureing she will have enough time for meals throughout the day.

Noticing a potential time conflict, she removes one section and adds another with a different instructor. Later, she duplicates the schedule to experiment with alternative elective combinations. This feature allows her to explore “what-if” scenarios without risking the integrity of her original plan.

By the end of the session, she has multiple potential schedules and can confidently select the one that balances workload, interest, and timing. The app has transformed a previously stressful, error-prone task into a streamlined, interactive experience. She logs off feeling in control and prepared for the semester ahead.
